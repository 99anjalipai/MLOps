# Pipelines with AutoML and Pre-built Containers

In this lab, we'll explore how to create end-to-end pipelines and get online predictions in Vertex AI.
Two ways discussed here are:
- Using AutoML
- Using Pre-built containers

## 1. End-to-End using AutoML
**Steps:**
- Dataset creation
- Train Model with AutoML
- Evaluate and Deploy the model to Endpoint
- Get online prediction using REST

###  Create a Dataset
**From the Console:**
- Go to Vertex AI
- Selected `Datasets`
- Select `CREATE DATASET`
