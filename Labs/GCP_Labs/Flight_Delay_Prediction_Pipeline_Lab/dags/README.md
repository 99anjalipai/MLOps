## README: Cloud Composer Orchestration for ML Model Training and Deployment

### Overview

This README provides a detailed explanation of the workflow to automate the preprocessing, training, and deployment of a machine learning model using Google Cloud Composer (Airflow), Google Batch, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Repository.

### Workflow Summary

1. **Data Storage**: Training data is stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket at a fixed path.
2. **Dockerization**: Using GitHub Actions, the code for preprocessing and model training is dockerized and pushed to Google Container Registry (GCR).
3. **Cloud Function Trigger**: When data is uploaded to the GCS bucket, it triggers a Cloud Function (`trigger-dag`) that starts the DAG in Cloud Composer.
4. **Google Batch Job**: The DAG submits a Google Batch job using the latest Docker image from GCR. This image contains the commands to perform preprocessing and model training.
5. **Model Upload**: The Batch job uploads the preprocessed data and the trained model (`model.pkl`) to GCS.
6. **Model Deployment**: A Flask server deploys the model and uses it for predictions. Another workflow is set up for deploying this server on a VM and simulating users by calling the Flask API.
7. **Email Notifications**: The DAG sends email notifications on success or failure of the entire process.


### Steps to Implement

1. **Prepare Data and GCS Bucket**
   - Upload your training data to the specified GCS bucket path.

2. **Dockerize and Push to GCR**
   - Use GitHub Actions to dockerize your preprocessing and model training code.
   - Push the Docker image to GCR.

3. **Cloud Function to Trigger DAG**
   - Set up a Cloud Function (`trigger-dag`) that gets triggered when new data is uploaded to the GCS bucket. This function should trigger the DAG in Cloud Composer.

4. **DAG in Cloud Composer**
   - Define the DAG as shown above. The DAG includes tasks to get the latest Docker image tag, create a batch job configuration, submit the batch job, monitor the batch job, delete the batch job, and send email notifications.

5. **Batch Job Configuration**
   - The `create_batch_job` task creates the configuration for the Google Batch job, specifying the Docker image to be used and other job parameters.

6. **Monitoring and Email Notifications**
   - The `monitor_gcs_file_task` task uses a GCSObjectExistenceSensor to wait for the `model.pkl` file to be uploaded to GCS.
   - Upon completion, either success or failure emails are sent based on the job outcome.

7. **Model Deployment**
   - Once the model is successfully uploaded, deploy it using Vertex AI (not covered in detail here but can be extended similarly).

### Conclusion

This setup orchestrates the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model training and deployment using various Google Cloud services, ensuring automation and scalability. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can implement a robust machine learning pipeline with Google Cloud Composer and Google Batch.
